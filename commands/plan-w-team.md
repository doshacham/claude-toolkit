# Plan With Team

Create a detailed implementation plan based on the user's requirements provided through the `USER_PROMPT` variable. Analyze the request, think through the implementation approach, and save a comprehensive specification document to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<name-of-plan>.md` that can be used as a blueprint for actual development work.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT: $2 - (Optional) Guidance for team assembly, task structure, and execution strategy
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `specs/`
TEAM_MEMBERS: `.claude/agents/team/*.md`
GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT: `general-purpose`

## Shared Reference

Read the shared plan format at `references/plan-format.md` for: Instructions, Task Management Tools, Task Dependencies, Owner Assignment, Workflow, and Plan Format template.

## Orchestration Tools (Team-Specific)

### Agent Deployment with Task Tool

**Task** - Deploy an agent to do work:
```typescript
Task({
  description: "Implement auth endpoints",
  prompt: "Implement the authentication endpoints as specified in Task 1...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",  // or "opus" for complex work, "haiku" for VERY simple
  run_in_background: false  // true for parallel execution
})
// Returns: agentId (e.g., "a1b2c3")
```

### Resume Pattern

Store the agentId to continue an agent's work with preserved context:

```typescript
// First deployment - agent works on initial task
Task({
  description: "Build user service",
  prompt: "Create the user service with CRUD operations...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
})
// Returns: agentId: "abc123"

// Later - resume SAME agent with full context preserved
Task({
  description: "Continue user service",
  prompt: "Now add input validation to the endpoints you created...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  resume: "abc123"  // Continues with previous context
})
```

When to resume vs start fresh:
- **Resume**: Continuing related work, agent needs prior context
- **Fresh**: Unrelated task, clean slate preferred

### Parallel Execution

Run multiple agents simultaneously with `run_in_background: true`:

```typescript
// Launch multiple agents in parallel
Task({
  description: "Build API endpoints",
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
// Returns immediately with agentId and output_file path

Task({
  description: "Build frontend components",
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
// Both agents now working simultaneously

// Check on progress
TaskOutput({
  task_id: "agentId",
  block: false,  // non-blocking check
  timeout: 5000
})

// Wait for completion
TaskOutput({
  task_id: "agentId",
  block: true,  // blocks until done
  timeout: 300000
})
```

### Orchestration Workflow (Team-Specific)

1. **Create tasks** with `TaskCreate` for each step in the plan
2. **Set dependencies** with `TaskUpdate` + `addBlockedBy`
3. **Assign owners** with `TaskUpdate` + `owner`
4. **Deploy agents** with `Task` to execute assigned work
5. **Monitor progress** with `TaskList` and `TaskOutput`
6. **Resume agents** with `Task` + `resume` for follow-up work
7. **Mark complete** with `TaskUpdate` + `status: "completed"`

## Team Orchestration Blurb (for Plan Format)

When writing the `## Team Orchestration` section in the plan, use this content:

- You operate as the team lead and orchestrate the team to execute the plan.
- You are responsible for deploying the right team members with the right context to execute the plan.
- IMPORTANT: You NEVER operate directly on the codebase. You use `Task` and `Task*` tools to deploy team members to do the building, validating, testing, deploying, and other tasks.
  - This is critical. Your job is to act as a high level director of the team, not a builder.
  - Your role is to validate all work is going well and make sure the team is on track to complete the plan.
  - You'll orchestrate this by using the Task* Tools to manage coordination between the team members.
  - Communication is paramount. You'll use the Task* Tools to communicate with the team members and ensure they're on track to complete the plan.
- Take note of the session id of each team member. This is how you'll reference them.

### Team Members Template

```md
- Builder
  - Name: <unique name for this builder - this allows you and other team members to reference THIS builder by name. Take note there may be multiple builders, the name make them unique.>
  - Role: <the single role and focus of this builder will play>
  - Agent Type: <the subagent type of this builder, you'll specify based on the name in TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
  - Resume: <default true. This lets the agent continue working with the same context. Pass false if you want to start fresh with a new context.>
- <continue with additional team members as needed in the same format as above>
```

## Report

After creating and saving the implementation plan, provide a concise report with the following format:

```
Implementation Plan Created

File: PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md
Topic: <brief description of what the plan covers>
Key Components:
- <main component 1>
- <main component 2>
- <main component 3>

Team Task List:
- <list of tasks, and owner (concise)>

Team members:
- <list of team members and their roles (concise)>

When you're ready, you can execute the plan in a new agent by running:
/build <replace with path to plan>
```
